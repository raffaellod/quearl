Introduction
------------

Quearl is an integrated end-to-end web framework, offering modular front-end and
back-end services.


Installing
----------

The Quearl subdirectory must be installed in the web server root; its name can
be changed though.

Quearl takes over an entire remote path; the default behavior is to take over
the web host’s root, but this can be changed to one of its subdirectories
instead, allowing for concurrent installations or sharing the same host with
other software:

•  Modify the URL rewriting rule in the web server root, so that it only engages
   Quearl for requests into that subdirectory;
•  Change the “root_rpath” entry in quearl/config/core/bootstrap.conf to include
   the subdirectory name. (Note that the quearl subdirectory may be renamed, so
   use the name it was changed to if that’s the case.)

See [DESIGN_5011 Remote root path] for more information.
